  Get started with Tailwind CSS

Tailwind CSS works by scanning all of your HTML files, JavaScript
components, and any other templates for class names, generating the
corresponding styles and then writing them to a static CSS file.

It's fast, flexible, and reliable — with zero-runtime.


      Installing Tailwind CSS as a PostCSS plugin

Installing Tailwind CSS as a PostCSS plugin is the most seamless way to
integrate it with frameworks like Next.js and Angular.

01


        Install Tailwind CSS

Install |tailwindcss|, |@tailwindcss/postcss|, and |postcss| via npm.

Terminal

|npm install tailwindcss @tailwindcss/postcss postcss

|

02


        Add Tailwind to your PostCSS configuration

Add |@tailwindcss/postcss| to your |postcss.config.mjs| file, or
wherever PostCSS is configured in your project.

postcss.config.mjs

|export default {  plugins: {    "@tailwindcss/postcss": {},  }}

|

03


        Import Tailwind CSS

Add an |@import| to your CSS file that imports Tailwind CSS.

CSS

|@import "tailwindcss";

|

04


        Start your build process

Run your build process with |npm run dev| or whatever command is
configured in your |package.json| file.

Terminal

|npm run dev

|

05


        Start using Tailwind in your HTML

Make sure your compiled CSS is included in the |<head>| /(your framework
might handle this for you)/, then start using Tailwind’s utility classes
to style your content.

HTML

|<!doctype html><html><head>  <meta charset="UTF-8">  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">  <link href="/dist/styles.css" rel="stylesheet"></head><body>  <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold underline">    Hello world!  </h1></body></html>
